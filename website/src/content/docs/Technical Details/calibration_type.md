#### Choosing the Right Calibration Type

If you're unsure which is good, just let it to default auto selection.

- **Direct Vavle Based** (recommended for most users) - lets Better Thermostat directly set the target temperature on the TRV via valve changes. This makes sure BT have the total control over the heating.
- **Target Temperature Based** (if Direct Vavle Based is not supported) - lets Better Thermostat set the target temperature on the TRV by adjusting the target temperature with an offset. This is less precise than Direct Valve Based but works with more TRVs.
- **Offset Based** (recommended only if you want to have the "real" target temp displayed on the TRV) - lets Better Thermostat adjust the target temperature on the TRV by applying an offset to the target temperature. This is less precise than Direct Valve Based or Target Temperature Based but allows you to see the actual target temperature on the TRV.
