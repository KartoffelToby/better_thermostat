# Better Thermostat

**For more info visit: https://better-thermostat.org/**

### Requirements

- Minimum required Home Assistant version: `2024.12`
  (_Latest tested version: `2025.3.0`_)

### Companion UI

We've created a companion UI element which can display more information than the default thermostat element in Home Assistant. Check it out via HACS: [better-thermostat-ui-card](https://github.com/KartoffelToby/better-thermostat-ui-card)

- If you have a question or need help please create a new [discussion](https://github.com/KartoffelToby/better_thermostat/discussions) or check if your question is already answered

- If you want to contribute to this project create a new [pull request](https://github.com/KartoffelToby/better_thermostat/pulls)

### Features

This integration brings some smartness to your connected radiator thermostats setup:

- Uses a temperature sensor far away from the radiators to measure the real room temperature
- Makes your TRVs fully compatible with Google Home
- Let your windows disable your heating (avoid programming this via an automation)
- Your weather forecast provider will turn your heat on/off
- Or an outside air temperature sensor can do this as well
- Does some valve maintenance automatically, to avoid them getting stuck closed over the summer
- Group multiple TRVs to one (e.g. for a room with multiple radiators)
- Enhance the default TRV Algorithm with some smartness to reduce energy consumption

### Which hardware do we support?

**We support all thermostats which are compatible with Home Assistant as long as they are shown up as a climate entity**

***Integrations that are tested***
- Zigbee2Mqtt
- Deconz
- Tado
- generic_thermostat

### How to setup

Install this integration via HACS or copy the files from the [latest release](https://github.com/KartoffelToby/better_thermostat/releases/latest)

Configuration details can be found in the [documentation](docs/Configuration/configuration.md) or on our website: [better-thermostat.org](https://better-thermostat.org/configuration)


Some nice-to-know config tips for the configuration.yaml
#### Example Window/Door - Sensor config

```yaml
group:
  livingroom_windows:
    name: Livingroom Windows
    icon: mdi:window-open-variant
    all: false
    entities:
      - binary_sensor.openclose_1
      - binary_sensor.openclose_2
      - binary_sensor.openclose_3
```

#### Combine multiple TRV to one (Group)

No worry, Better Thermostat supports grouping out of the box
